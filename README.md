# QuantumDesign SQUID data analyser

A Python script for quick analysis of moment-vs-field (MH) curves of ferromagnetic samples measured using a QuantumDesign SQUID VSM. The script streamlines the data analysis of MH curves by allowing users to easily remove initial saturation, paramagnetic backgrounds and drifts from MH curves.
